# Minecraft Launcher Index
An ever-expanding list of Minecraft game launchers.

# Adding a launcher
You can either: <br>
* [Create a new issue](https://github.com/deprecatedbrain/minecraft-launcher-index/issues/new) with the project and basic information or <br>
* [Fork](https://github.com/deprecatedbrain/minecraft-launcher-index/fork) this repository, add your project to the README.md, and make a pull request.
If you're going to fork it and modify the readme, I'd recommend using [this](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) markdown table editor with compact mode turned on. You can import the table through it and edit it.
